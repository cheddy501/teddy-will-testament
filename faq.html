  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <p><strong>Q: Why is estate planning important?</strong><br>
  A: Estate planning helps you protect your assets and ensures your wishes are respected, reducing stress for your loved ones and avoiding potential legal conflicts.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What services do you provide?</strong><br>
  A: We provide Last Will & Testament preparation, Grant of Probate, Grant of Administration, setting up trusts, and preparing Powers of Attorney for financial, legal, healthcare, and personal care matters.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: How can I get started?</strong><br>
  A: Contact us using our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> or call us directly to schedule a consultation tailored to your needs.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Do I need a lawyer to prepare a will in Belize?</strong><br>
  A: While it is possible to draft a will on your own, Belize has specific legal requirements for a valid will, including proper witnessing. Having an attorney ensures your will meets these requirements and accurately reflects your wishes, avoiding issues during probate.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: What happens if I die without a will?</strong><br>
  A: If you pass away without a will, you are considered to have died “intestate,” and the High Court will determine how your assets are distributed according to Belizean law, which may not align with your wishes.</p>
