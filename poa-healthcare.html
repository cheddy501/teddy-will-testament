  <p><strong>What is a POA for Healthcare?</strong></p>
  <p>
    A Power of Attorney for Healthcare & Personal Care is a legal document that authorizes someone to act on your behalf regarding medical decisions, treatment plans, and personal care choices if you become incapacitated or unable to communicate your wishes. Your appointed representative can speak with doctors, manage care plans, and ensure decisions align with your values and beliefs during critical times.
