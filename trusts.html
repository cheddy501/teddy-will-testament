  <h2>Trusts</h2>
  <p>
    Establishing a trust is a powerful way to protect your assets and ensure your beneficiaries are cared for according to your wishes. At C&J Estate Planning Consultancy, we guide you through the process of setting up trusts, whether for minor children, family members with special needs, or managing your estate efficiently to minimize probate complexities and taxation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Why Consider a Trust?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Trusts can help you:
    <ul>
      <li>Protect your assets from creditors and unnecessary taxation.</li>
      <li>Provide for loved ones with clear, enforceable instructions.</li>
      <li>Maintain privacy over your estate distribution.</li>
      <li>Manage assets for minors or beneficiaries who need guidance in handling inheritance.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
