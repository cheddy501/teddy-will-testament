  <p><strong>Probate In Belize</strong></p>
  <p>In Belize, probate is the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate if they died leaving a Last Will & Testament. If they died without a Last Will & Testament, a grant of Administration is then needed to settle disputes against it, and allocate their belongings. This procedure applies to assets that were owned by the deceased at the time of their passing, with the exception of assets like trusts and foundations that are intended to avoid probate. A Belize probate lawyer should be consulted if you are the executor of an estate that contains assets in Belize, such as a trust or a holiday house. The process is called testamentary probate proceedings when a person passes away with a will. An intestate death occurs when a person passes away without leaving a will.</p>

  <p>Our team can guide you in gathering required documents, preparing the application, and ensuring compliance with Belize’s probate laws, giving you clarity and peace of mind throughout the process.</p>
